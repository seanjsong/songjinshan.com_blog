## Nemiroff Delikat

Perhaps the cheapest vodka I can think of. Cheap as it is, it still holds a genuine flavor of vodka. Economic for daily consumption.

## Nemiroff Cranberry

Too sweet and short of vodka flavor. I always use it as a liqueur and never drink it straight.

## Nemiroff LEX

Nemiroff's premium brand - LEX. The bottle has a distinctive shape. One day I happened to recall that it appeared as the first scene in Lady Gaga's MV *Bad Romance*. The taste is just plain, though.

## Absolut vodka mode edition

I can't perceive any difference between all those "editions" of Absolut vodka. I believe they are exactly the same, and only the bottles differ. Again, the bottle becomes the only reason I bought yet another "edition".

## Crystal Head

The skull-shaped bottle and glasses are so cool! It's the most expensive liquor I've bought so far, solely for the skull shape. But to my disappointment the skull is not as integrated as I supposed. It's like two glass patches melted together with an inconspicuous seam in between. It tastes as purified as Gray Goose. And it costs more than Gray Goose because it has a pretty bottle.
