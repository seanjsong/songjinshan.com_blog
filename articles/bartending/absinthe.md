# Absinthe

Absinthe - my favorite type of liquor, partly for its high alcohol concentration, partly for its peculiar flavor of anise, fennel, and wormwood.

## Rudolf

The most common brand that can be bought in China. Due to its high alcohol concentration (68%), the liquid always floats atop in a glass of cocktail, in gleamingly green color.

## La Clandestine

Born in Switzerland, somewhat considered to be the origin of absinthe, this brand has a long historical standing. Despite its supreme heredity, it can rarely be found in China. I asked my classmate who studies in Switzerland to bring me a bottle. It has a heavy anis taste. Just take a sip and feel your throat burning, and take a sniff and feel your nose buring - very special feeling:) When mixed with water, it will emulsify and change flavor. I don't like the emulsified taste, so I'd like to drink it straight or mixed with sambuca.

Interestingly, the distiller's friend found me by Google Alarm after I first posted this page on my blog. And he explained to me why emulsification occurs with La Clandestine but not with Rudolf - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louche>. In one word, all anise-flavored liqueurs and spirits should have this louche effect. Rudolf doesn't have this effect because it doesn't have anis in it.
